<!-- <h1> Abstract </h1>
<p>
A key challenge in single image 3D shape reconstruction is to ensure that deep models designed for single-view shape prediction can generalize to shapes which were not part of the training set. We find that such generalization to unseen categories of objects is a function of both architecture design and object pose representation during training. This paper introduces SDFNet, a novel shape prediction architecture and a training approach which supports effective generalization. We provide an extensive investigation of the factors that influence generalization accuracy and its measurement, ranging from the consistent use of 3D shape metrics to the choice of rendering parameters. We show that SDFNet provides state-of-the-art performance on seen and unseen shapes relative to existing baseline methods. We provide the first large-scale experimental evaluation of generalization performance on the complete ShapeNetCore.v2 dataset.

    <p>
    We demonstrate that, unlike classification task, reconstruction tasks do not suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning continually. The reconstruction algorithm used is standard SGD run on each learning exposure. We <i>do not need to utilize additional losses, external memory, or other methodsto achieve good continual learning performance</i>. Average accuracy on seen classes is shown at each learning exposure in the following plots.

<h1> Representation Positive Transfer in Reconstruction Tasks </h1>
<p>We demonstrate that, unlike classification task, 3D shape reconstruction task is able to propagate the learned feature representation forward between learning exposures (referred to as positive forward transfer), which is presumably one of the keys to the success of reconstruction tasks. In the following experiment, we utilize GDumb <a href="#GDumb">[1]</a> and a variant of GDumb, GDumb++, which differs from GDumb in that the model trained at each exposure is initialized with the weights learned in the previous exposure (ie. not starting from scratch). Since both GDumb and GDumb++ are trained on the same amount of input data, any performance gap is attributable to the value of propagating the learned representation.

<h1> Proxy Task for Continual Classification</h1>
<p>
  We utilize the learned feature representation extracted from a continual 3D shape reconstruction and apply nearest-class-mean (NCM) to perform classification. We maintain an exemplar set of 20 images/class with
  class labels randomly chosen from the training set at each learning exposure. The performance of this proxy task is on par with the SOTA classification algorithm with the same exemplar set size.

<h1> YASS&mdash;Simple Baseline for Classification </h1>
<!-- <center><img src="img/abc_shapenet_img.png" ></center> -->
<p>
We introduce YASS, a class incremental learning method that is a simple extension of a batch learner with standard SGD and data balancing technique. We demonstrate that this simple design choice surprisingly achieves SOTA performance.

<h1> DyRT&mdash;A Novel Tool To Quantify Forgetting </h1>
<!-- <center><img src="img/abc_shapenet_img.png" ></center> -->
<p>
We introduce DyRT (Dynamic Representation Tracking), a novel tool to quantify the dynamics of forgetting in the visual feature representation during
continual learning. With DyRT, we demonstrate that the FC layer is more prone to forgetting than the feature extractor, confirming the findings from prior works.
